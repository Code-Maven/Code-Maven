Created the Git repository of Code-Maven, created <a herf="https://github.com/szabgab/Code-Maven">GitHub repositor</a>
and even a <a href="https://github.com/Code-Maven">GitHub organization</a>.
I've also registered the <a href="http://code-maven.com/">code-maven.com</a> domain and configured it with a single page
serverd by <a href="http://plackperl.org/">Plack</a> linking back to the GitHub repository.

Turned on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a>

Started the script to fetch the most <a href="https://metacpan.org/recent">recent CPAN releases</a>
and to add them to <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>.

Implemented some very simple code to show "news" or "blog" of the site.
