More than 10 days since the previous post, since the last time I could work on Code::Maven. I am not exactly sure what triggered it, probably the
need to ensure the smooth deployment of the Code::Maven application, but in the last 10 days or so, I have been working on 
<a href="http://dwimperl.com/linux.html">DWIM Perl for Linux</a>. It is a <b>"batteries included"</b> Perl distribution for Linux.
By now it arrived to the point that I can rebuild it quite easily, I can add more modules, and I can upgrade the ones that were included
in previous releases. I am now running two of my servers, almost all of my sites on DWIM Perl for Linux. Including this site.

So now I can start to turn my attention back to Code::Maven. I started to download CPAN distributions and unzip them on one hand,
and on the other hand the page of each distribution has started to show the log related to that specific distribution.
