Working late makes you tired the next day.

Started to work on the <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> integration.

In the meanwhile <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/perl">perl 5.20.1 was released</a> so
I went ahead installed it using <a href="http://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a> and installed
all the prerequisites of Code::Maven and my other projects. I did this on my two home systems
but the machine where I am going to deploy Code::Maven still run Ubuntu 12.04. I plan to
upgrade it before I really deploy the code.

Anyway, today I converted the embedded HTML into <a href="http://template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a> files.

Getting Started with Semantic UI

Visit the web-site of <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic-UI</a> and download the zip file.
Create an empty directory and unzip the file there. (It does not create a root directory by itself)

The examples/ directory contains an example for the <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/build/examples/homepage.html">Cat University</a>.
It is not as nice as the main page of Semantic UI.
It seems the other directories contain the same code in varius formats. 

<ul>
  <li>less/           - needs the less preprocessor</li>
  <li>minified/       - each css and js files is minimized</li>
  <li>packaged/       - all the css and js files are packed into a single file for each type. There is also a minimized version of each such file.</li>
  <li>uncompressed/   - The uncompressed source files?</li>
</ul>

In my project I created a subdirectory called 'static' that will serve the static files, and copied some files over:

<pre>
cp packaged/css/semantic.min.css static/css/
cp packaged/javascript/semantic.min.js static/js/
cp packaged/images/* static/images/
cp packaged/fonts/* static/fonts/
</pre>

I also found a couple of <a href="http://ehkoo.github.io/semantic-ui-examples/theme/">Semantic UI examples</a>
