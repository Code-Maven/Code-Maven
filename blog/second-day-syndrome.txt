Working late makes you tired the next day.

Started to work on the <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> integration.

In the meanwhile <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/perl">perl 5.20.1 was released</a> so
I went ahead installed it using <a href="http://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a> and installed
all the prerequisites of Code::Maven and my other projects. I did this on my two home systems
but the machine where I am going to deploy Code::Maven still run Ubuntu 12.04. I plan to
upgrade it before I really deploy the code.

Anyway, today I converted the embedded HTML into <a href="http://template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a> files.
Then added <a href="/blog/getting-started-with-semantic-ui">Semantic UI</a> to the mix and further improved the blog part.
